The Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) System is a tool designed to identify and classify emotions from spoken audio. 
It leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze audio features and predict the emotional state of the speaker. 

=> Features :-
- Emotion Detection: Recognizes and classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutrality.
- Audio Preprocessing: Includes noise reduction, feature extraction (e.g., MFCC, chroma, mel spectrogram), and normalization.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Supports various machine learning models like SVM, Random Forest, and deep learning models like CNN, LSTM.
- Real-Time Emotion Recognition: Processes live audio input to detect emotions in real-time.
